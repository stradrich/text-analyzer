A modern, responsive Text Analysis Tool built with React.js (Next.js) for the Offline Coding Challenge.
It allows users to paste or type text and instantly see analysis such as word count, character count, sentence count, paragraphs, longest word, most frequent word, and more.

This project was created using Next.js App Router and styled with TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui.

🛠 Getting Started

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install


Run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev


Then open:

👉 http://localhost:3000

The app will auto-reload on file changes.

📘 How It Works (Approach)
🔍 1. Text Analysis Logic

All calculations are done inside:

src/lib/useTextAnalysis.ts


This hook:

Receives the raw text

Normalizes casing

Removes punctuation where necessary

Performs all analytics in a single pass where possible

Returns an object consumed by UI components

This separation keeps the UI clean and improves testability.

🎨 2. UI + Responsiveness

Built with React Server Components (Next.js App Router)

Layout is fully responsive using Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities

Input automatically scrolls on overflow

Stats are displayed in reusable StatCard components

⚡ 3. Performance Considerations

No expensive nested loops

No heavy regex

All operations are O(n)

Designed to handle large pasted text (articles, essays, reports)

⭐ Optional Features Planned (Not Implemented)

PDF/CSV Export

Sentiment Analysis

Docker Deployment

Unit Tests

(These were optional for the challenge.)

📦 Building for Production
